## Week 1

### Goals

- Learn all the material in the *Getting-Started* notebook.  This notebook covers basic Python: expressions including strings and lists, variables, functions (including lambdas), loops (`for` and `while`), using the `random` library, using `matplotib` for graphs, using (just a little) `numpy`.

- Work through part of the problem set to make sure you know the material in *Getting Started*

- Discuss and work on some math/physics/whatever problems of interest, e.g., (a) simulation of coin tossing experiments and analyzing the statistics thereof, (b) implementation of random number generators and analyzing the statistics thereof, (c) production of white and brown noise and analysis of their power spectrum, (d) dynamical systems, e.g., iteration of the quadratic map.
