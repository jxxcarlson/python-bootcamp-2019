# Python BootCamp 2019

This repository contains the instructional material
for Jim Carlson's section of the 2019 Python Bootcamp
at Ohio State University.

The exercises can be found on [knode.io](https://knode.io/1231)
and also in the `problem_sets` directory here.  The Jupyter
notebooks for class are in `weekly_lessons`.  I will also
be using material from [Applying Python](https://knode.io/113).
